    Webhooks is a lightweight webhooks server written in Clojure. It
    allows to set up webhook endpoints and corresponding shell
    commands, which will be executed when the endpoint is
    requested. The config file is written in EDN (the preferred
    clojure data format). The config file will be read per request, so
    there is no restart required after updating the config file.

    p_slides is a "static files only", dead simple way to create
    semantic slides. It neither needs a server, installed software,
    pre-compilation nor a special editor. Neither editing nor
    presenting has any external dependencies - it's just a html file.
