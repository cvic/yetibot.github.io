    Pseudocult (which is an anagram to "cloud setup") enables you to
    set up your cloud (AWS) declarativly and consistently.

    It is mainly a clojure program that you run providing one or more
    config files, which describe your cloud setup. Pseudocult will
    detect discrepancies between the current state of the cloud and
    the description obtained from the config files as well as take
    action to overcome the discrepencies.

    Webhooks is a lightweight webhooks server written in Clojure. It
    allows to set up webhook endpoints and corresponding shell
    commands, which will be executed when the endpoint is
    requested. The config file is written in EDN (the preferred
    clojure data format). The config file will be read per request, so
    there is no restart required after updating the config file.

    Swiss Crowdfunder is a crowd funding and equity funding platform.
    It is a joint product with [ungleich glarus ag](https://ungleich.ch/).

    ## Why did we do it?

    Crowdfunding using established platforms can be very expensive.
    Usually, there is a fee of 12-20% that has to be paid. **Swiss
    Crowdfunder** is fully open source - therefore it can be used by anyone to
    start their own crowdfunding platform or campaign.

    ## Open source

    **Swiss Crowdfunder** is released under the popular
    [AGPL license](https://github.com/200ok-ungleich/swiss-crowdfunder/blob/master/LICENSE),
    has a
    [contribution guide](https://github.com/200ok-ungleich/swiss-crowdfunder/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
    as well as a
    [code of conduct](https://github.com/200ok-ungleich/swiss-crowdfunder/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md),
    is
    [fully configurable](https://github.com/200ok-ungleich/swiss-crowdfunder#configuration)
    and has a community
    [Mattermost chatroom](https://github.com/200ok-ungleich/swiss-crowdfunder#configuration).

    For more information, visit
    [https://github.com/200ok-ungleich/swiss-crowdfunder](https://github.com/200ok-ungleich/swiss-crowdfunder), star the project and become part of it!

    ## Hosted SaaS

    Next to the OSS version, we run and support our hosted SaaS
    version at
    [https://swiss-crowdfunder.com/](https://swiss-crowdfunder.com/).
    If you don't want to get too technical, get in touch with us at
    info@200ok.ch and we will host your campaign for an 8% fee.

    We also offer coaching and support in how to set up a proper
    crowdfunding campaign and optimize your marketing efforts. Call or
    write us anytime!

    Codegraph is a command utility written in about 50 lines of
    Clojure. It reads Clojure code with Clojure's builtin function
    `read-string`, analyzes the code and generates a dot file, which
    can be fed into Graphviz to generate a dependency graph of the
    given code. It works nicely with ClojureScript. And it's a
    beautiful demonstration of Clojure's homoiconicity (which is a
    fancy technical term for "code is data").

    p_slides is a "static files only", dead simple way to create
    semantic slides. It neither needs a server, installed software,
    pre-compilation nor a special editor. Neither editing nor
    presenting has any external dependencies - it's just a html file.
