  description: >-
    Clojure is a dynamic, general-purpose programming language,
    combining the approachability and interactive development of a
    scripting language with an efficient and robust infrastructure for
    multithreaded programming. Clojure is a compiled language, yet
    remains completely dynamic – every feature supported by Clojure is
    supported at runtime. Clojure provides easy access to the Java
    frameworks, with optional type hints and type inference, to ensure
    that calls to Java can avoid reflection.

    Clojure is a dialect of Lisp, and shares with Lisp the
    code-as-data philosophy and a powerful macro system. Clojure is
    predominantly a functional programming language, and features a
    rich set of immutable, persistent data structures. When mutable
    state is needed, Clojure offers a software transactional memory
    system and reactive Agent system that ensure clean, correct,
    multithreaded designs.

    source code to easily write and read your structured data to and
    from a variety of data streams and using a variety of languages.
