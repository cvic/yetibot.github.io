    We support our clients and products in all areas of Unix/Linux
    infrastructure. 200ok works with true DevOps in mind where our
    developers are not just developers, but have a strong
    background in different flavors of Unix and Linux. All our
    applications are deployed through automated configuration
    management, many run within containers, all have automated
    monitoring and exception notification and either run in Swiss data
    centers on private networks or on any cloud service provider.

    We also offer to support and maintain the applications that we
    build at various levels to meet the clients' demands - from
    regular security updates to adding new functionality. In
    cooperation with our partners we are able to provide 24/7 on-call
    service.
