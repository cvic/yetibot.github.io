We are happy to announce that Yetibot is sponsored by DigitalOcean as part of
their awesome [Open Source Sponsorship](https://www.digitalocean.com/open-source/) program!

These credits allow to run the
[public Yetibot instance](https://public.yetibot.com)
and a corresponding Postgres database on DO's cloud. This instance:

- provides the [GraphQL API](https://yetibot.com/dev-guide#graphql_api) that
  powers the docs at [yetibot.com](https://yetibot.com), and
- connects to [Yetibot Slack](https://slack.yetibot.com) and
  [Yetibot Mattermost](https://yetibot-mattermost.herokuapp.com/) so users can
  play and test the bot

<strong>Thank you, DigitalOcean!</strong> Your generous open source program
removes hurdles for Yetibot and countless other open source projects. ⚡️
