OptaPlanner optimizes those planning problems to do more business with less resources.\nOptaPlanner is a lightweight, embeddable planning engine. It enables normal Java™ programmers to solve optimization problems efficiently. Constraints apply on plain domain objects and can reuse existing code. There’s no need to input difficult mathematical equations. Under the hood, OptaPlanner combines sophisticated optimization heuristics and metaheuristics (such as Tabu Search, Simulated Annealing and Late Acceptance) with very efficient score calculation.\nOptaPlanner is open source software, released under the Apache Software License.

OptaPlanner optimizes those planning problems to do more business with less resources.\nOptaPlanner is a lightweight, embeddable planning engine. It enables normal Java™ programmers to solve optimization problems efficiently. Constraints apply on plain domain objects and can reuse existing code. There’s no need to input difficult mathematical equations. Under the hood, OptaPlanner combines sophisticated optimization heuristics and metaheuristics (such as Tabu Search, Simulated Annealing and Late Acceptance) with very efficient score calculation.\nOptaPlanner is open source software, released under the Apache Software License.
