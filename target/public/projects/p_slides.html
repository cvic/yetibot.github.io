<ul>
<li>Only think about content, don't worry about styling</li>
<li>Static files only, no need for a server, installed software, pre-compilation or a special editor (unless of course your favorite and very special editor!)</li>
<li>For editing and presenting, there are no external dependencies - it's just a html file (therefore it can easily be put into version control for example)</li>
<li>Extendable and supporting themes</li>
<li>Write slides in markdown</li>
</ul>
